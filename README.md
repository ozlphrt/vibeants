# üêú Ant Foraging & Path Optimization Simulation

An interactive web-based simulation that demonstrates how ants find food and optimize their paths using pheromone trails. This project showcases the fascinating emergent behavior of ant colonies and their applications in computer science.

## üåü Features

### Interactive Simulation
- **Real-time ant behavior**: Watch ants search for food and return to the nest
- **Pheromone trail visualization**: See how chemical signals guide ant movement
- **Path optimization**: Observe how shorter paths become more prominent over time
- **Dynamic food sources**: Multiple food locations with depleting resources

### Educational Content
- **How ants find food**: Step-by-step explanation of the foraging process
- **Key concepts**: Stigmergy, positive/negative feedback, emergence
- **Real-world applications**: Vehicle routing, network optimization, manufacturing

### Interactive Controls
- **Number of ants**: Adjust from 10 to 100 ants
- **Pheromone evaporation**: Control how quickly trails fade (0.01 to 0.1)
- **Food sources**: Set 1 to 5 food locations
- **Reset simulation**: Start fresh with new food placement

## üöÄ How to Run

1. **Open the project**: Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser
2. **No installation required**: Everything runs in the browser using vanilla JavaScript
3. **Start exploring**: The simulation begins automatically

## üî¨ How It Works

### Ant Behavior Algorithm
1. **Random Search**: Ants initially explore randomly for food sources
2. **Pheromone Laying**: When an ant finds food, it returns to the nest while laying pheromone trails
3. **Trail Following**: Other ants are attracted to stronger pheromone trails
4. **Path Optimization**: Shorter paths get reinforced faster, creating optimal routes
5. **Evaporation**: Pheromones fade over time, preventing suboptimal solutions

### Key Mechanisms

#### Stigmergy
- Indirect communication through environmental modification
- Ants leave pheromone trails that influence other ants' behavior
- No direct communication between individual ants

#### Positive Feedback
- More ants on a path = stronger pheromone trail
- Stronger trails attract more ants
- Creates self-reinforcing optimal paths

#### Negative Feedback
- Pheromone evaporation prevents getting stuck in suboptimal solutions
- Allows the system to adapt to changing conditions

#### Emergence
- Complex, optimal behavior emerges from simple individual rules
- No single ant knows the best route
- Collective intelligence through simple interactions

## üîß Customization

You can modify the simulation by editing the JavaScript parameters:

```javascript
// In simulation.js, adjust these values:
this.antCount = 30;           // Number of ants
this.evaporationRate = 0.05;  // Pheromone decay rate
this.foodCount = 2;           // Number of food sources
this.gridSize = 10;           // Pheromone grid resolution
```
